                Once uppon a time, fellow hackers were in a hacker camp. At some point, the internet stopped working.
                Turns out some rodent had eaten a fiber. This rodent became the most hated thing in a 10km radius for a
                while (even more hated than systemD)<br><br>
                This has lead to the drawing of the squirrel eating the cable that is now printed on most NOC equipment 
                in those camps (if you go there, you will find a lot of references to it). Turns out that the person who drew it is
                also a lovely member at our hackerspace :-) . So, when we decided to transit our own IPv6's, we got the
                idea of giving it a little homage.<br><br>
                Projects and links will come with time. We are in a move right now. So we are still reconstructing the
                entire network. (you can come and say hello BTW ;-) <a href="https://hsbxl.be/">hsbxl.be</a> if
                interested)<br><br>
                (as you can see, we currently don't do webdesign... But if you want to help, <a
                    href="https://gitlab.com/hsbxl/squirrelco-website">here</a> is the repo :) )
